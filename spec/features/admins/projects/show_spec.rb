This project is relatively small with 20-25 volunteers and tasks may be technical in nature as you install water bars, check steps, and other drainage structures as well as build new rock step stream crossings. If you are new to trail work, don't worry! No previous experience is required; just be prepared to work hard at high altitude among classic Colorado views.", active: true, image: 'https://www.voc.org/sites/default/files/styles/760x420/public/op_images/ShelfLake_8.jpg?itok=_ZH6V4li')
